## Diffusion-Limited-Aggregation-Simulation
Using a simulation of square particle, diffusion-limited aggregation, the avoidance of using length parameters in calculating the fractal dimension of simulated DLA clusters was found to give a more precise result. The fractal dimension was 1.72 ±0.03, which was independent of how many particles are in the cluster greater than 500. If the probability of forming a bond between cluster and incident particle is not 1, the fractal dimension of the cluster will exhibit change proportional to the probability at the power of (5.0 ±0.1)〖x10〗^(-2).
